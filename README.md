# C-Bomberman
**A Bomberman game made in C**

This is an open-source Bomberman game I'm developing to learn more about the C programming language and SDL2, and also for fun, of course.

### Compiling

This program can be compiled using the provided Makefile.

1. **Install SDL2 (on Ubuntu/Debian):**  
If you're using a Linux distribution such as Ubuntu or Debian, make sure you have SDL2 installed. You can do this by running the following commands:

    ~~~
    sudo apt-get update  
    sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev
    ~~~

2. **Compiling the game:**  
Once SDL2 is installed, run the following command to compile the program using the included `Makefile`:

    ~~~
    make
    ~~~

   This will build the project, and you'll be able to run the game.

### Running the game

After compiling, you can run the game with:

~~~
make run
~~~

Make sure you have the necessary assets (sprites, sounds, etc.) in the `res` folder.
